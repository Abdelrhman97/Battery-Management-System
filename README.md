# Battery Management System (BMS)


## Description

The Battery Management System (BMS) is a project aimed at developing a software solution for monitoring and controlling lithium-ion battery packs. The BMS ensures the safe and efficient operation of the batteries by managing parameters such as state of charge (SOC), state of health (SOH), and temperature. It provides real-time data analysis, fault detection, and protection mechanisms to enhance battery performance and lifespan.

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Battery Management System. The project aims to provide a reliable and scalable solution for battery management, suitable for various applications such as electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and portable electronic devices.
