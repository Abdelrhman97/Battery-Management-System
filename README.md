# Battery Management System (BMS)

## Description

The Battery Management System (BMS) is a project aimed at developing a software solution for monitoring and controlling lithium-ion battery packs. The BMS ensures the safe and efficient operation of the batteries by managing parameters such as state of charge (SOC), state of health (SOH), and temperature. It provides real-time data analysis, fault detection, and protection mechanisms to enhance battery performance and lifespan.
